DxE Philly API
==============
Used by dxephilly.org to pull out Facebook events.

You can query:

* `/facebook/events`
* `/facebook/events/upcoming`
* `/facebook/events/upcoming/next`

That's it for now.

Note that you need to drop in a file called `facebook_access_token` in the root in order to use this. Any access token will do, as this information is all public.
